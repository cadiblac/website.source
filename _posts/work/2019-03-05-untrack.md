[Untrack](https://untrack.online) is a desktop app to block all known tracking websites from spying on your internet activity. Untrack stops all tracking websites from tracking your online activity.

## How it works.

It simply replaces your hosts file with a crowdsourced list of all known tracking websites. List of tracking domains are maintained by [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)

## What it blocks

-   38k+ Tracking websites
-   2k+ Gambling websites
-   12k+ Porn websites
-   2k+ Social media websites

Yes, that is a total of 55k+ tracking domains.

## Why we did this?

We know that this is a 1 minute job for a programmer to have this running in your computer. But our idea is to allow each and every common internet user to be able to escape from these trackers.
